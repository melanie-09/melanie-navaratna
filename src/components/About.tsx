            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>Hi! My name is Melanie Navaratna.</p>
            <p>My education: I have been interested in computer science since middle school - I was captivated by the adorable
                Baymax from the movie Big Hero 6, and dove head-first into learning Python so I could program a robot like him.
                Though I strayed away from robotics, I learned more about computer science in high school through classes and research
                projects. Now, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science at Rice University. I am also minoring
                in Business to improve my leadership, communication, and management skills because these are all crucial aspects of 
                working with others in any situation.
            </p>
            <p>
                My interests: Through my coursework and projects at Rice University, I have developed a solid foundation in 
                languages such as JavaScript, HTML, and CSS; studied various programming design principles; and built web
                applications. Additionally,
                I have been fascinated with art for as long as I can remember. I love painting, nail art, crocheting, 
                drawing, and much more. Each of these forms of art requires great attention to detail and the ability to view 
                your work from another perspective. I enjoy being able to apply these skills to design captivating and functional 
                user interfaces.
            </p>
            <p>
                My passions: As a queer woman of color, it is clear to me how far behind technology is in serving disadvantaged
                communities. As a queer woman of color in computer science, I strive to help these communities in my career by 
                recognizing and working to erase the disparities they face. I hope
                I can inspire young people like me to improve this field by being a leader and standing firm in my beliefs.
